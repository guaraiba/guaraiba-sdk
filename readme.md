## Guaraiba

It is a framework developed in JavaScript and qooxdoo that allows the creation of web applications NodeJS under the
Model View Controller architectural pattern.

It is based on the framework "Ruby on Rails" and take advantage of the benefits of qooxdoo for the development,
compilation and documentation of applications under the paradigm of object-oriented programming.

### Characteristics:
* An guaraiba application  is created from a server application in qooxdoo that inherits from guaraiba.Application.
  Similarly this provides the basis classes for the implementation of the controllers, the model classes, the
  controller routing and the application configuration classes.
* The basis classes of the data model facilitate interaction with databases MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite3 and
  Oracle managers.
* It offers multiple authentication services such as local, ldap, soap, facebook, google and others of the family of
  the passport modules in NodeJS.
* It contains a layer of abstraction for the development of complete REST services.
* It allows the implementation of views on formats ejs, handlebars, jade, jasper report and mustache.
* Allows natively and in correspondence with the views implemented, generating responses to requests in formats txt,
  json, js, xml, html, xhtml, pdf, docx, rtf, pptx, xlsx, xls, csv, odt, ods ODP, swf and jpeg.
* Allows configure and run the application as a cluster in relation with number of processors available on the server.
